#Vib-CUE

Welcome to Vib-CUE. This program is designed to make the development of Vib-Ribbon level packs easier. This tutorial will go over how to use this website.

##The Buttons

When you choose one of the options on the main menu, You will be greeted with the song editor, as well as a bunch of buttons. Let's go over them.

####Duplicate
This button will duplicate the song. This is useful if you want to test out several variations of a song, since track number influences Vib-Ribbon's beatmaps.

####Delete
This button will delete the song.

##Creating And Editing CUE Files

To create a level pack from scratch, click "Create a CUE file" on the main menu. To open a CUE file, click "Open a CUE file."

Creating a level pack will give you a level pack with a placeholder song. You may delete this if you wish. Opening one will give you the existing songs in the pack. 

To add songs, you can either click the "Add song" button to enter a filename manually, or you can drag in a file or a series of files to automatically add its/their name(s) to the pack.

You can use the afforementioned buttons to edit the track listing.

##Saving Your Pack

When you're ready to save, right click the Save text at the top of the editor and click "Save Link As." This will open a dialog in which you can choose where to save your pack. This is recommended, as you need the music files to be in the same directory as your CUE file.

When you want to edit or create another pack, press the reload button.
