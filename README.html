Welcome to Vib-CUE. This program is designed to make the development of Vib-Ribbon level packs easier. This tutorial will go over how to use this website.

<h2>The Buttons</h2>

When you choose one of the options on the main menu, You will be greeted with the song editor, as well as a bunch of buttons. Let's go over them.

<br>
<h4>Duplicate</h4>
This button will duplicate the song. This is useful if you want to test out several variations of a song, since track number influences Vib-Ribbon's beatmaps.
<br>
<img src="delete.png" style="border-color: black;border-style: solid;"width=64>
<br>
<h4>Delete</h4>
This button will delete the song.
<br>
<img src="add.png" style="border-color: black;border-style: solid;"width=64>
<br>
<h4>Add song</h4>
This button will add a song to a file. For example, if you wanted to add a song to "New track.wav", you would click the Add button next to "New track.wav."

<h2>Creating And Editing CUE Files</h2>

To create a level pack from scratch, click "Create a CUE file" on the main menu. To open a CUE file, click "Open a CUE file."
<br>
Creating a level pack will give you a level pack with a placeholder song. You may delete this if you wish. Opening one will give you the existing songs in the pack.
<br>
To add songs, you can either click the "Add song" button to enter a filename manually, or you can drag in a file or a series of files to automatically add its/their name(s) to the pack.
<br>
You can use the afforementioned buttons to edit the track listing.

<h2>Saving Your Pack</h2>

When you're ready to save, right click the Save text at the top of the editor and click "Save Link As." This will open a dialog in which you can choose where to save your pack. This is recommended, as you need the music files to be in the same directory as your CUE file.
<br>
When you want to edit or create another pack, press the reload button.
